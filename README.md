# CrimeNet: Neural Structured Learning using Vision Transformer for Violence Detection 

## CrimeNet

CrimeNet is a Visit Transformer (ViT)-based deep learning model that employs structured neural learning with adversarial regularization for violence detection. In this repository we show some tests carried out with videos of violence in real environments.

## Performances CrimeNet

This section shows some performance of the CrimeNet model.

## Code

This repository provides the evaluation code and the pre-trained CrimeNet model for the UBI-Fights dataset. It can be found in the UBI_Fights directory. In it you can find the evaluation Jupyter notebook EvaluateCrimeNet, the script with the ViT model architecture and in the subdirectory results in the file check.txt you can find the link to download the pre-trained model.
